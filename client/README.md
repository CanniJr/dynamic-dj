## Spewtify
    Spotify clone.
    
    Steps:
    1. Create React App
    2. go to developer.spotify.com and login using your account
    
    I used yarn in the client folder and for consistency, all the necessary packages in client will be installed with Yarn package manager.
    
    yarn add spotify-web-api-node in client folder also
    - axios for data fetch
    - react-spotify-web-playback
